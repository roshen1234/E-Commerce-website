first we have use npx create-react-app <name> to create a react app

then to get redux tookit template we have to type npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/cra-template-redux react-app in a new terminal by opening a new vs code 

then from that copy the full content inside template/src and paste it inside our src in the react app then  we get the redux tempelate 

first we are setting up frontend first then only backend so to test frontend we use a site dummy.json where we get a lot of data in json format we have to create data.json file in react app and paste the json code there 

then we have to install npm i -g json-server this will check the content in the data.json that we have created and gives us a port so that we can test our frontend we have to enter the code  json-server --watch ./src/data.json --port 8080
