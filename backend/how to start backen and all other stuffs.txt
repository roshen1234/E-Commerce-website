first type npm init
then create index.js file
then after that add
"start":"node index.js",
"dev":"nodemon index.js",
commands insite script in package.json agter that to run we can just enter npm run devnpm

(to know node current version just enter node -v)

after that enter npm install express mongoose

then start writing code in app.js

to use cors we have to install it first npm i cors

//STORING JWT TOKEN IN setCookie
after doing jwt authenticarion we get the token then to store the token, after jwt sign that is after the cookie is made we stre it in set cookie presnt in header for that after sign we use the command 
res.cookie('jwt', token, { expires: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000), httpOnly: true })
we can find this code in express api refernce,response, res.cookie()
after this backend has done it work now we have take this code in frontend and sent with each request

//STORING IN COOKIE
when we do the above one in networks in login under header we can see the jwt token but we need it in application then cookie it is not there because of cors problem so we make the fronend and backend one and run both in backendport to bring it there we have to first make build for frontend that is npm run build and then paste the build in backend then in backend in index.js we have to paste the code 
server.use(express.static('build'))
after this inside application in cookie we will find our cookie after that under each api request under cookie we will have our jwt token

after this for each time we make change in frontend we have to make a new build and paste it in backend again

//MIDDLEWARE CODE TO TAKE THE COOKIE AND USE IT TO MAKE TOKEN
now each api request has this cookie and inside it there is jwt token but for each api request to use it we have to put the below given code in fetchuser middleware 

let token=null
   if(req && req.cookies )////
   {
    try {
        token=req.cookies['jwt']/////
        const decoded=jwt.verify(token,Secreat_Key)
        req.user=decoded.id
        next()
the /// code is used to store the jwt token that is passed by frontend as cookie inside token 
and to use req.cookie we have to install  npm install cookie-parser and put 
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
server.use(cookieParser())
in index.js

//RELOADING
for stoping reloading we have made checkAuth api where it just returns the user id,we put this in app.js so app.js runs first so each time when it gets called the checkAuth runs and user will be present and since there is user it will not go to login page,this happens because once we cretaed a cookie by loging in it is stored it doesnot get lost untill another cookie is created,when we login again the current cookie get overrrided

but the problem here is even when we reload from a different page we come back to product page because first it goes to login page then since it finds out there is user due to chechAuth api it navigate to product so to remove that we keep a checkUser in authSlice which at first is false and when user comes its true we put this in app.js for all routers so when it is false routing doesnot happen when it is true that is when user comes it become true and routing happens since when user comes there is no need to go to login page so it stay in the same page 

//stripe payement setup 
first we havto open react stripe website then there go down we can see adding payment option click that and on the next page select node and react then custamizable so that we can customize according to our wish then first to use it we have to install in backend  
npm install --save stripe
in that page copy the entire server.js code and paste in backend index.js

wehook is used basically when the payement has become succefull or recieved in stripe it has to give information to our server(backend) for that we use webhook
now to use webHook THERE IS TWO WAYS one is using the endpoint that we use for our actual project before that we have to test the webhook for that we use STRIPE CLI were they provides cases and triggers the webhook and we can see the response is correct or not after that when we want to use in our app we have to create endpoints and in that we can check  the payemnts made through our website whether it was successfull or not the message is pased to backed from stripe.Now to use STRIPE CLE for testing we have to first go to developer in stripe then in there test in a local enviorment(since we are testing in local devise that is our device) and sice we havnt it used till now click download cli then dowload for window version we have download in comad line and then to use it is visual code we have to do some thing both for instalation and using in vs code we have vedio 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJu8vQH7hLY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOhR9ocSvLE
then after creating we have to enter stripe login then we get a link and there we activate cli now we can use stripe cli 
after that install
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/webhook
as given in that page 
then copy the code in the right side of the page and paste it in the index.js at top otherwise error will come 
after that we have to enter 
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded

{we can keep all our secreat keys in .env fileofr that first we have install
npm install dotenv 
then import 
require('dotenv').config()
then we can get each name mentioned there as process.env.<Name> example
process.env.END_POINT_SECRET}

now continuing webHook
